question: 'Why donate by cryptocurrency and not by bank?'
answer:
    - ' Lower transaction fees: Unlike bank transactions, crypto donations charge lower fees, remember that in situations like these, every penny helps and can be a next meal for a child in Gaza.'
    - "No middlemen: Banking transactions can have processes with intermediaries that affect the flow of your donation, such as imposing more fees or imposing certain restrictions, that's why we rely
      on crypto."
    - 'Accessibility and speed: Interbank transfers can take hours or even days to be reflected, especially if they are international. With crypto transactions, the process is much more immediate.'
    - 'Privacy and security: Banks require personal information to make transfers, if you want to make the donation anonymously, using crypto is the ideal option.'
